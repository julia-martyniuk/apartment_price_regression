# Apartment Price Prediction

This repository contains the final project for the course "Machine Learning: Classification Methods" at the University of Warsaw. The project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms to model and predict apartment prices.

# Project Overview

## Objective: 
Build predictive models for apartment prices using a training dataset and generate predictions for a test dataset.

## Techniques used:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering<br>
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)<br>
- Machine learning algorithms for regression tasks (SVR, KNN, Ridge, Elastic Net, XGBRegressor)<br>
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Outcome: 
Identification of the most effective modeling approach for predicting apartment prices, with insights into feature importance and prediction accuracy.

# Repository Contents
